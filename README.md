## ✨ Try it in your browser ✨

## Use additional Python packages

JupyterLite comes with a few pre-installed packages such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, etc...  

You can install additional packages within the Jupyter Notebook: 
```python
import piplite
await piplite.install("package_name")
```

Note: Packages without a wheel available on PyPI might be incompatible. [[learn more]](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html)
